# JavaScript Drum Kit
For this mini-project, the assignment was to build a drum kit with JavaScript which plays a drum, cymbal or percussion sound corresponding to the pressed key. The idea is not to use any frameworks or libraries, just pure JavaScript to build the app using starter code. I started the html and JS files from scratch but did use starter css file and modified some of the styling. The exercise and the audio come from the **JavaScript30 Coding Challenge by Wes Bos**, which is a free online course which gets to to build 30 apps in 30 days. You can find the course [here](https://javascript30.com/).

The assignment is part of **The Odin Project** curriculum, which is free and open source and uses on freely available resources in each of the modules. The ethos of the project is learning by building things, with the added bonus of creating projects that can be showcased in a portfolio.
